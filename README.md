# Overview
The Newton method is a numerical algorithm used to find the roots of a function. It is an iterative method that starts with an initial guess of the root and then refines the estimate using the function and its derivatives. The method is named after Sir Isaac Newton, who is credited with its discovery.

The Newton method is a powerful technique for solving a wide range of problems, including nonlinear equations, optimization, and numerical integration. It is widely used in scientific computing and engineering.

# Usage
The Newton method can be implemented using any programming language that supports numerical calculations. Here is a sample implementation in Python:
